        I'm a UI developer with a background in both <strong>Fine Art</strong> and <strong>Creative Multimedia Programming</strong>. I have spent the past few years working with <a href="https://www.adaptemy.com/" class="btn-4">Adaptemy</a> in Dublin, Ireland. Together with this team of ridiculously talented people I helped to build an e-learning platform used by teachers and students in a number of different countries across the globe.
